> How to add a new resource to [learn_to_program.md](https://github.com/umentor/umentor/blob/master/learn_to_program.md)

Adding more things to learn from is great! Please add your resource under the appropriate heading, creating new ones where necessary. Also write a few words describing your resource! For example: if it's a paid resource, what format it's in (video, ebook, tutorial), if it's particularly good for beginner or advanced people, etc.

You can follow the fork-clone-pull request model for adding a new resource, or you can edit the file on the web. When editing on the web, Github will give you an option to create a new branch and open a pull request -- choose this one!

Pull request reviewers may ask you to reorganize your additions or provide more detail. Please do so promptly, as merge conflicts are common if people are adding resources under the same topic.
